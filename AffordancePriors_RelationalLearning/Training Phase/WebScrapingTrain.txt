The type of grate determines how you wash your burners.
 If you have an uncoated grate, use a scouring pad to clean the grate.
 If you have a coated grate, use a soft sponge.
If you have a stainless steel hood, use a cleaning product meant to be used on stainless steel.
If you have an electric stove, remove the racks and put the oven on cleaning mode.
 When the cycle has ended, use a damp cloth to remove any residue left by the cleaning cycle.
Combine two tablespoons baking soda and one quart water.
 Dip a sponge in the solution, then wipe down the entire surfaces of the fridge, making sure to scrub out sticky stains.

Wipe down every drawer and shelf, not just the main part of the fridge.
If you have wooden cabinets, consider using a cleaning supply specifically made for wood.
You could also buy some cleaning supplies to wipe your counters down with.
 There are many anti-bacterial sprays, disposable wipes and de-greasing products.
If your counters are made with granite or stone, you should use cleaning supplies specifically made for that kind of countertop.

your toaster, your coffee maker, your blender and your coffee grinder.




Fill a large stainless steel pot with about 3 to 4 inches (7.
62 to 10.
16 cm) of water.


Place a slightly smaller stainless steel pan into the water of the first pan.


Set the pans onto the stove.


Pour your raw milk into the second pan.


Clip a thermometer to the side of the second pan into the milk.


Put a stopper in the drain of your sink.
 Fill the sink with cold water and ice.
 Because the process of heating the milk is fairly quick, preparing the cooling procedure ahead of time prevents overheating the milk.
Crank the heat to high.


Stir repeatedly to prevent burning the milk.
 Milk that reaches boiling or higher temperatures can cause scorching.


Keep the milk at 161 degrees Fahrenheit (71.
66 degrees Celsius) for 30 seconds.
 You might need to decrease or increase the burner in order to keep a steady temperature of 161 degrees Fahrenheit (71.
66 degrees Celsius).


Cool the milk to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.
44 degrees Celsius), stirring constantly.
 This can take as much as 40 minutes.
 The milk will cool slowly and unevenly if you do not stir.



For a true formal dinner setting, you should have enough matching placemats for all of the guests, and the placemats should also match the tablecloth.
You can also fold your napkin to the left of the forks after you put them down.
If you forget where each fork should go, just think of the order in which you would eat your meals.
 You would have your salad before your dinner, and you should eat from the outside in, using the utensils from left to right, so the salad fork would go to the left of the dinner fork.
Remember that you should be eating with the utensils from the outside in, starting with the ones on the outside of the plate and working your way closer to the plate until the end of the meal.
If you mix up where the forks and knife should go, just think of how a right-handed person would use a fork and knife to cut something.
 If you sit down and mimic the gesture, you'll see that you would pick up the fork with your left hand and the knife with your right, so that's where each utensil should go.
Note that in some traditional settings, the soup spoon is actually larger than the teaspoon.
A bread and butter plate and knife.
 Place this small round plate about five inches above the forks.
 Place a small knife horizontally over the plate, with the blade facing to the left.
A dessert fork and spoon.
 Place the small dessert fork and spoon horizontally a few inches above the plate, with the spoon on top of the fork facing left, and the fork facing right.
A coffee cup.
 Place the coffee cup over a small saucer a few inches above the outermost utensil on the left and a few inches to the left of it.
A red and white wine glass.
 If you have two different glasses, then the white wine glass will be the one closer to the guest, and the red wine glass will be slightly above and to the left of the white wine glass.
 You can remember this because guests should move from white to red wine.
